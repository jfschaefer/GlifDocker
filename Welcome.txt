Welcome to GLIF!

You may either create new notebooks or take a look at our example notebooks in
the notebooks folder.  The README file in the notebooks folder will provide
more information on them.

The MMT folder contains the MMT installation. It is visible, because it may be
helpful for certain debugging scenarios.

Here are some useful links:
